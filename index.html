      <p>
        My name is Rene Montoya-Menjivar from South Gate, California which is a city in South Los Angeles. I studied mathematics for undergrad at Azusa Pacific University and mathematics education for grad school at DePaul University in Chicago. Most of my job experience is in the mathematics education field; I was a math tutor most of my college year who then became a math teacher for a few years. Post grad school I was hired at my current company. My job now does have some math education in it but it is centered around college student success. 
        The goals I have at the moment is creating programs or systems to improve on exisiting mathematical methods of teaching and/or assessment. My whole passion has been on sharing math with others and breaking this stigma of it being so hard. Especially within people of color! :) 
        Intersting facts about me are that I have a deep love for the Japanese language, and took 3 years of courses in college. I also am the first in my family to receive a college degree.
